              Christmas is celebrated on December 25th each year and has roots
              in both religious and cultural traditions. The holiday
              commemorates the birth of Jesus Christ in Bethlehem, but its
              history goes back much further.

              The origins of Christmas can be traced to ancient Roman festivals
              such as Saturnalia and the celebration of the winter solstice. The
              early Christian Church wanted to provide an alternative to these
              pagan festivals by celebrating the birth of Christ during the
              winter.

              Over the centuries, Christmas has become a global holiday with
              various traditions and customs such as the decorating of Christmas
              trees, exchanging of gifts, and the appearance of Santa Claus,
              whose modern version was popularized in the 19th century.
